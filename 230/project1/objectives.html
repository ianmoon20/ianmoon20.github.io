            In League of Legends there's a primary objective, destroying the enemy nexus, which is required for winning (exluding surrenders). However, there are a few more minor objectives that exist. Here is a list of all the objectives present on the Rift:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Towers</li>
            <li>Inhibitor</li>
            <li>Nexus</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="content-header">Towers</div>
        <div class="maincontent">
          <p>
            Towers are the bastions of safety for champions on the League. If an enemy creep or champion goes under a tower, the tower will attempt to smite them down, prioritizing minions first unless an enemy champion hits a friendly champion, in which case the enemy is doing what is called "diving", or attacking under the tower, and the tower will immediately target the offending player.

            Towers award gold when destroyed and the first tower destroyed in the match gives the player who destroyed it a large sum of bonus gold. 
          </p>

      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="content-header">Inhibitors</div>
        <div class="maincontent">
          <p>
            Inhibitors can be destroyed once all the towers in their lane have also been destroyed. Once destroyed, that lane's cannon minion will be replaced with a super minion which spawns every wave. These super minions are not to be left unattended, as they will smash through normal minions and push into your base if you do!
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, Inhibitors do not stay destroyed. They periodically respawn and once they do the super minions will no longer spawn. More importantly, however, is that the Nexus can not be damaged while all Inhibitors are alive. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The Nexus is your ultimate goal. You destroy this, you win the game. No matter how many kills you have, no matter how many creeps or objectives you've killed, the team who destroys the enemy team's Nexus first wins. However, as mentioned before, this is easier said than done. At a minimum, you have to destroy three lane towers, one inhibitor, and two nexus towers all while fighting the other enemy champions along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            TIP: Last hitting the enemy Nexus results in 50 gold!
