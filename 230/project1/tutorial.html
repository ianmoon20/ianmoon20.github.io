            Whether you are new to MOBAs or just new to League of Legends, there are a few things you need to know in order to hop in and play smoothly. I make no promises that I will cover every little detail that it takes to get you to Challenger, the highest rank in the game, but by the time I'm done you should have a pretty clear idea of how to play the game. Enough wasting time, let's get started...

            I'm not going to lie, League feels a bit wonky at first. This is especially true if you've never played a MOBA or RTS game before. Here are the basic default controls you'll need to understand:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Left Mouse - Select Object</li>
            <li>Right Mouse - Give Command (Moves you if mouse is over ground or attacks if over hostile)</li>
            <li>Q, W, E, R - Uses the corresponding ability</li>
            <li>D, F - Uses your chosen <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Summoner_spell">Summoner skills</a></li>
            <li>B - Takes you back to base after a short channel</li>
            <li>Y - Toggles whether the camera is locked onto your champion</li>
            <li>Space - If your camera isn't locked, centers the camera on your champion</li>
            <li>Tab - Displays Scorescreen</li>
            <li>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - Uses activateables purchased from the shop. (More on that later)</li>
            <li>Complete List <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Hotkeys_and_commands"> Here</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This may look daunting at first, but trust me it becomes second nature over time. This also isn't the full list but I believe it to be the necessary bits. Hotkeys can also be changed in the menus.
          </p>

          <p>
            TIP: If you are new to the genre, I highly recommend locking the camera to your champion. It will take camera control out of the equation until you are more comfortable with the other, in my opinion, more important mechanics.

            Now, I know you want to get out there and start murdering the enemy team and carrying your team to victory but first, don'tcha think you're going to need items? Well, in order to get those we're going to have to teach you how to get the gold to buy it.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are a couple ways to do this, listed in order of occurance:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>"Last hitting" - Dealing the killing blow to enemy minions/creeps/monsters.</li>
            <li>Murder - Killing an enemy champion</li>
            <li>Assisted Murder - Being an accomplice to the above</li>
            <li>Destroying structures - Destroying Towers, Inhibitors, and, yes, even the Nexus (+50).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Breaking these down... creeps will most likely be your main source of income. They are plentiful, they are weak, and they are dumb. No matter how many you kill, there are always more on there way! However, as you get into higher and higher divisions you'll realize just how important an individual creep's worth is in gold can make the difference between a won and lost lane. So try not to miss any! A good Champion, or character, to ease the last hitting process is <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Annie">Annie</a>, as she can use her Q ability to freely farm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Murder and/or assisting in the art of murdering is also a way of earning gold! It's also more fun! However, what seperates it from the mindless farming of endless creep waves is that it is also risky. The other player is just as ready and willing to murder you as you are him, so be careful. As you continue to learn the game you'll realize when you can murder and can't murder. You'll also learn when your opponent can do it to you. So get in there and science your heart out! It's probably best to not focus on this until you've gotten the hang of the other mechanics, however.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, blowing stuff up for money. While also furthering your objective to destroying the enemy nexus, this method of moola generation can also fill you and your teammates gold lined, diamond encrusted plated pockets. It's a fairly simple process too! Kill your opponents creeps quicker than he's killing yours and watch as they do most the work for ya! However, you have to be careful. If you "push" to fast, other members of the enemy team might notice you and come to keep you in check, mafia style. A good champion for this is <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Teemo">Teemo</a>.

            "Where do I spend all my hard-earned gold though? It's getting awfully heavy!", I hear you saying, but don't worry we've thought of that. The shop is a wonderful bizarre of trinkets and heirlooms that will help you with your murderous and explosive tendancies. To get there from anywhere on the map, press that nifty B key by default. Once you are teleported back to the fountain, you can open the shop by clicking on the tab to the left of the minimap that has a gold symbol on it.
          </p>

          <p>
            TIP: The shop is fairly expansive with a ton of items to choose from, so for new players I recommend sticking to the Recommended builds page or going to <a href="http://www.mobafire.com/">Mobafire.com</a> and looking up the champion you are going to be playing. Most the time these even come with a handy guide!
