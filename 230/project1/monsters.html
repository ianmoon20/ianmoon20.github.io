          <p>
            There are many monsters on the rift, but as a beginner player there are three main, epic baddies that you'll have to know a little bit about:
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Dragon</li>
              <li>Rift Herald</li>
              <li>Baron Nashor</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            Each of these monsters gives an award for slaying them, a spawn location, and typical times when they are targetted. Also, each monster respawns periodically.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="content-header">Dragon/Drake</div>
        <div class="maincontent">
          <p>
            Dragon/Drake is most likely to be the first epic monster you face on the Rift. However, not every dragon has the same element and each element rewards your team differently for slaying (stacking with multiple kills of the same kind):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Air Dragon - Movement Speed</li>
            <li>Earth Dragon - Structure/Epic Monster Damage</li>
            <li>Fire Dragon - Damage</li>
            <li>Water Dragon - Out-of-Combat HP/Mana Regeneration</li>
            <li>Elder Dragon - Burn affect on champions attacked + amplifies other dragon buffs</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These dragons spawn randomly with the exclusion of elder, which only spawns after four dragons have been slain in total.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dragons are typically targetted throughout the game so you'll always have to keep an eye on them. However, Fire and Elder Dragons are much more sought after so be particularly aware when either of these are about to spawn.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="content-header">Rift Herald</div>
        <div class="maincontent">
          <p>
            Rift Herald is essentially the little brother of a baddie we'll talk about later, Baron Nashor. While he may be smaller, this guy can pack quite the punch! Typically two people on a team are required to kill him and once slain he'll drop an orb that buffs whoever picks it up. If you want more information on the buff, you can click <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Rift_Herald">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rift is typically attempted after a laner dies on the top side of the map and must be taken before 19 minutes and 45 seconds, because at this time Baron spawns and murders this little guy. Be very careful, as the player who recieves the buff from Rift Herald will be a serious threat.
          </p>

            Oh man, the Baron. This monster dominates the rift with it's presence. Typically requiring an entire team to slay, the Baron is a formidle foe who has a large health pool and deals a huge amount of damage to whoever it targets as well as a decent amount of single target damage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps more frightening than the baron himself is a team that slays it and gets a team-wide super Rift Herald buff! When this happens your best bet is to hunker down behind your towers and try to weather the storm.
          </p>

          <p>
             The best way to stop this from happening, however, is to slay the opposing team when they try! Baron is infamous for causing winning teams to lose the game as the other team collapses upon them. Most teams know this now, so they attempt to kill off the opponent team before trying to slain the king of the rift. As such, this monster is typically taken in the late game when teams are trying to finish out the game.
