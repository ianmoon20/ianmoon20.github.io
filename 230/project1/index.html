          League of Legends is a free-to-play MOBA which was released by Riot Games on October 27, 2009. League has managed to become incredibly popular since it's release, largely due to the freemium model which allows anyone to play but also allows players the option to buy microtransactions to either speed up progress or for cosmetics for champions. The epitome of this is captured in the yearly World Championship, where the best teams from all around the world compete for a cash prize.
