    <h1>Logo Image:</h1>
    <img src="Week11Logo.png"/>
    <h3>Format: PNG-8</h3>
    <h3>Achieved File Size: 11.6KB</h3>
    <p>The reasoning behind using PNG-8 for the logo image was due to the simplicity of the image. Because the image does not involve many colors and is simple in design, PNG-8 can display the image, without losing a substantial amount of quality, in less space then either JPEG or GIF files. </p>

    <h1>Photo Image</h1>
    <img src="Week11Photo.jpg" />
    <h3>Format: .jpg</h3>
    <h3>Achieved File Size: 645KB</h3>
    <p>The reason I used jpg for this image is because jpg's lossy compression allows for a smaller file size when transparency does not have to be maintained. The image above has no transparent sections, therefore jpg could remove pieces of the photo to reduce size without having to worry about increasing the size of the photo by filling in white space.</p>
