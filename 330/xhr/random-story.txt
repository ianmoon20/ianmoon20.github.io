<h2>Phillip Thornton</h2>
<p>Phillip Thornton looked at the peculiar book in his hands and felt stressed.</p>

<p>He walked over to the window and reflected on his dull surroundings. He had always hated cold Cambridge with its thundering, tart trees. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.</p>

<p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Barry Parker. Barry was a stable friend with ruddy elbows and charming fingernails.</p>

<p>Phillip gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a wild, funny, whiskey drinker with ruddy elbows and dirty fingernails. His friends saw him as a vigilant, vivacious vicar. Once, he had even helped a petite kitten cross the road.</p>

<p>But not even a wild person who had once helped a petite kitten cross the road, was prepared for what Barry had in store today.</p>

<p>The snow flurried like loving foxes, making Phillip calm.</p>

<p>As Phillip stepped outside and Barry came closer, he could see the ice-dancing glint in his eye.</p>

<p>"Look Phillip," growled Barry, with a brutal glare that reminded Phillip of stable owls. "I hate you and I want a resolution. You owe me 9343 dollars."</p>

<p>Phillip looked back, even more calm and still fingering the peculiar book. "Barry, I don't have the money," he replied.</p>

<p>They looked at each other with worried feelings, like two puny, petite puppies thinking at a very funny accident, which had classical music playing in the background and two tactless uncles sitting to the beat.</p>

<p>Phillip studied Barry's ruddy elbows and charming fingernails. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Phillip. "You will never get your money."</p>

<p>"No!" objected Barry. "You lie!"</p>

<p>"I do not!" retorted Phillip. "Now get your ruddy elbows out of here before I hit you with this peculiar book."</p>

<p>Barry looked irritable, his wallet raw like a kindhearted, kaleidoscopic knife.</p>

<p>Phillip could actually hear Barry's wallet shatter into 9343 pieces. Then the stable friend hurried away into the distance.</p>

<p>Not even a glass of whiskey would calm Phillip's nerves tonight.</p>
